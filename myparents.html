	<p>The man above is my father, and I called him Ayah. He was born on 28 September in 1957 currently he is 64 years old. He doesn't look like he is 64 
	years old, right? My dad is a Police pensioner, and he served as a police officer for more than 30 years. My dad is a strict father, he never allows his 
	children to go to someone else's house. Whenever you wanted to go out, you need to inform him where you're going, with whom, how long you are outside, and 
	what are you going to do. You can tell clearly that he is indeed a policeman. My dad has told me and my siblings why he made us do it, it was because he 
	wants to prevent us from becoming friends with bad people and end up doing wrong things that we might regret, such as getting involved in drugs. This is 
	because he has seen a few children of his colleagues doing illegal and wrong things such as getting involved with drugs. Back then I thought it was a 
	nuisance that I can't be like my friends where they are free to go anywhere they wanted without getting interrogated like me, but now I am thankful for my
	father because as I grew up, I can see clearly why he does it. I am thankful that with my dad's concern I never do anything wrong or getting involved in 
	crime and illegal activity. I can say that I grew up well because of my dad.

	<p>The woman above is my mother, and I called her mama. She was born on 01 August in 1964, and is 57 years old. Like my father, My mother is also a very 
	strict mother. Back when I was young and even until now, my mother is the one who will choose my clothes and will have a say on anything that I do from 
	what I eat, wear, and what I do. The only thing that she let me decide is my future, she let me decide what I want to be and what I want to study. To be 
	honest, I don't really mind my mother controlling me as long as it is not a wrong thing, and it does not concern my future.
