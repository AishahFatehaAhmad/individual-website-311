	<p>Assalamualaikum and hi everyone. Welcome to Aishah Diary!!!
My name is Aishah Fateha Binti Ahmad and I am 20 years old. I hope you enjoy scrolling through my website. I'm not a professional on building and
managing a website, but I have tried my best to achieve  good results. I am in a difficult phase right now, my father just had an operation to remove a
Cancer tumor and he is in  recovery. After he's fully recovered, he will start with his chemotherapy treatment right away and currently I am the only
one who could help driving my mother and father to hospital for their treatments. I hope I can go through this semester without any problems and
managed to graduate next year. This is just a little bit of me expressing my feelings with words.</p>
