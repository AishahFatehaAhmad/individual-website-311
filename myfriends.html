  <h1>AISHAH FATEHA</h1>
  <p class="norm">WELCOME TO MY WEBSITE</p>
</div>
	<p id="intro">I have never had many friends in my whole life. In all my 20 years of living on earth, I only have 3 best friends. Due to my introvertness in 
		daily life, I hardly have friends. Due to my introvertness, I have low self-confidence and it constantly makes me feel that people are judging me, 	 
		whether it
		is about my clothes, my appearance, or other issues. Therefore, I tend to block other people from being close to me or from being in my world because I
		am scared that they will get bored with me and then leave me or betray me. You can probably guess that I've been left and betrayed in the past.Yeah,
		it's true that I got left and betrayed by people that I thought were my friends. I even got judged and shamed because of my physical appearance and got
		called names too. But as I grew up, I tend to let things like this go away. I keep reminding myself that Allah has created me perfectly and I should be
		thankful for it. Therefore, whenever it happens again, I also remind myself that I should improve myself and ignore negative comments from toxic people
		in my life. All I can say is, I know it's sad and hurtful when people say bad things about you when you did nothing wrong, but believe me, if you just
		ignore their comments and negativity, you will be happier. A gentle reminder from me is to not become like them to other people, even though you don't
		like them. If you don't like someone, just don't meet them or talk to them, but if you have to, then just talk to them about important things such as
		work, your studies, and other things.</p>

	<h2>AIN ZAFIRAH</h2>
	<br>
	<img src="fra.jpg" class="center">
	<p>Ain was one of my first friends from secondary school. I have known her for 6 years, since I was 15 years old. Ain and I have very obvious differences
		in personality and outlook. For instance, I am a very calm person, while Ain is the opposite of me. Other than that, Ain is a person that is different
		from others that I have met who love to judge others. Instead of judging others, she gave me advice on my appearance or personality. But due to these
		differences, we became close friends for six years and still counting. I started to know and become close to her because she was my classmate for 3
		years, from 15 until 17 years old.</p>
		<br>
	<h2>FATIN FATIHA</h2>
	<br>
	<img src="frf.jpg" class="center">
	<p>Fatin is someone that I have known since elementary school, but I wasn't close to her during elementary school. I started to become close to her when I
		was 16 years old, after she became my classmate. Along with her, my other friends, Ain and Hanisah, and I became best friends. I have been friends with
		her for 5 years and still counting. Fatin is a person that is brave and hardworking. What do I mean by brave and hardworking? Fatin is currently
		starting a small business which is becoming a dropship agent for a clothing brand. She works hard to gain profit and make money. Now she manages to
		havecustomers almost every day and promotes her business to others on a bigger platform.</p>
	<h2>NURUL HANISAH</h2>
	<br>
	<img src="frh.jpg" class="center">
	<p>I have been friends with Hanisah for 5 years since 16 years old and we are still counting. Hanisah is a lawyer-to-be as she is currently doing her degree in law at UiTM Shah Alam.
      Hanisah is a person hat likes to throw any thiughts of her to other people on any topic that interests her. She was a hardworking person whenever she wanted to achieve anything that         she wants. In 2018, I and the others will stay after school to study together for SPM, where I and Hanisah are the ones that usually stay afterschool for almost everyday because we         wanted to achieve  good results to further our studies.
